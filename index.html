            <h3>
                The First Night
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our story began on a cruise ride, where Lorenzo was set to perfom. 
                Unfortunately for him, he forgot to feed before the show started, causing him to appear all shriveled up, creating a delay for the show.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst Cléo came to sort out the backstage issues, a small sobbing sound could be heard from a nearby box, where the speakers for the show should've been. 
                Inside the box was Kissime, who hid after being turned.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an attempt to please the crowd whilst sorting out the shrivelled up Lorenzo/upset Kissime issue, Lorenzo attempted to use his necromancy to send Maurice out to play. The magic failed, causing him to just stand still, so Cléo threw a coin at his head from the crowd in an attempt to rouse him. 
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                Cléo, being <em>slightly</em> upset at the fact that the show she is managing was currently being ruined, threw the coin with enough rage that it tore through his head, causing him to die once again and rapidly decompose
            </p>
            <p>
                Lorenzo was forced to take the stage, covering his head up with a cape, leaving the rest of the guys to do body cleanup. They attempted to throw the body through the window, but were interrupted by one of Cléo's stalkers, a young college boy who looks up to her. 
                <br>
                Luckily enough for the team, Cléo managed to wipe his memory, causing him to forget what he witnessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was around this point that Cléo noticed a magic item in the pockets of Kissime. She decided to confront him, which caused Kissime to panic even more, leading to him frenzying, trying to escape this place

            </p>
            <p>
                The team stood in the way of the backstage exit, causing Kissime to flee using the only exit available ... by jumping through the window of the boat. Captain followed suit to save him, after yelling at others to get his boat</p>
            <p>
                The team got on Captain's boat after Kissime and the captain were hauled from the water by a small rescue boat. On there, Kissime got an explanation of what it means to be a vampire from Cléo, and Lorenzo got a bite to eat from a groupie of his, who is still recovering on the ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Kissime is a fledgling, the team decided to present him towards one of the two princes, as is tradition (and to avoid getting in trouble). They decided to go to the Prince of the East side, the Lasombra prince Lucia D'Angelo.
            </p>
            <p>
                While waiting in the Medici Chappel for the Prince, a shadow dropped over the crew, causing a silence that choked out all sound. 
                <br>
                The crew presented Kissime as a new fledgling, explaining that they had no idea who turned in, and showed the magic stone towards The Prince, who identified it as a bloodstone, a tracking device created from Tremere blood magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst at first polite, as a ruler should be, Kissime's disrespect infuriated her, causing her to lose her patience. 
                Now the team has one week time to figure out:
                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who sired Kissime?</li>
                <li>Why they sired him?</li>
                <li>Why they decided to place a tracking bloodstone on him.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If they fail to do so, they'll be greeted with their first sunrise since the afterlife started.

            <h3>
                The Second Night
            </h3>
            <p>
                The night came to an end, and the coterie rushed of to find shelter for the day, promising to meet up the next night to discuss their course of action. While the Captain took shelter in his ship, and Lorenzo offered Kissime shelter at his room in the speakeasy, Cléo was forced to reside in a hostel for the day. <br>
                This nearly proved disastarous, as a stray ray of light entered the room through the curtains. Luckily for her, she managed to keep the Beast under control, and got away with only minor damages to herself by cleverly hiding under the bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This disastarous occurence was only the beginning of a difficult night. Kissime arised with a hunger, forcing Lorenzo to leave him alone as he went towards the hostel Cléo was at, whispering her name at every door until she came out. After explaining the situation to Cléo, she was furious. Leaving Kissime alone was a recipe for disaster. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Cléo was right. The young fledgling had left the shelter of Lorenzo's room, and was searching around the speakeasy for something to fill this hunger he had. All food he tried tasted like ash in his mouth. There was only one thing that could sate him...
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunantly, Cléo managed to come back just in time, intervening before an accident happened. She however, was unsuccessful in leaving without drawing attention, as she had to forcefully drag Kissime away, and ended up yelling at him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lorenzo was on the hunt in the meantime, looking for a heartbroken drunk to lure with his song back to the speakeasy. <br>
                The Captain, who had been waiting for over an hour, was making his way foot to the speakeasy, after commanding his crew to find any and all information they could find about what happened the night Kissime arrived in Firenze.
                Everybody joined back up in Lorenzo's room, where Kissime finally managed to lessen, but not completly still, his hunger.

            </p>
            <p>
                The group decided to split up in teams, with Lorenzo and Kissime going to Clarice, Lorenzo's sire, and Captain and Cléo going towards the docks for clues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cléo and the Captain asked the harbor master for a list of the coming and goings of potential ships, and to figure out what happened to the (expensive!) speaker set that was in the box Kissime hid in. It seemed to be for naught, as they were unable to glance anything suspicious from the list. The Captain's crew also didn't turn up anything, but haven't stopped their search yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of Lorenzo and Kissime's visit was more fruitful, as Clarice gave away some helpful tips in exchange for some of Lorenzo's poetry. They managed to identify Kissime as a Tremere with his Corrosive Vitae, and suggested seeking for clues with the Anarchs or Prince Franscecco Beneditti, as the Tremere are part of the West side.
            </p>

            <p>
                The group reconvened, planning to go towards the West side prince tommorow. The Captain warned that his presence as a Lasombra wouldn't be appreciated, especially not one with ties towards the East side Prince.
