    <h1>
        Previously on Firenze By Night...
    </h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            Our story began on a cruise ride, where Lorenzo was set to perfom. 
            Unfortunately for him, he forgot to feed before the show started, causing him to appear all shriveled up, creating a delay for the show.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst Cléo came to sort out the backstage issues, a small sobbing sound could be heard from a nearby box, where the speakers for the show should've been. 
            Inside the box was Kissime, who hid after being turned.
        </p>
        <p>
            In an attempt to please the crowd whilst sorting out the shrivelled up Lorenzo/upset Kissime issue, Lorenzo attempted to use his necromancy to send Maurice out to play. The magic failed, causing him to just stand still, so Cléo threw a coin at his head from the crowd in an attempt to rouse him. 
        </p>    
         
        <p>
             Cléo, being <em>slightly</em> upset at the fact that the show she is managing was currently being ruined, threw the coin with enough rage that it tore through his head, causing him to die once again and rapidly decompose
        </p>
        <p>
            Lorenzo was forced to take the stage, covering his head up with a cape, leaving the rest of the guys to do body cleanup. They attempted to throw the body through the window, but were interrupted by one of Cléo's stalkers, a young college boy who looks up to her. 
            <br>
            Luckily enough for the team, Cléo managed to wipe his memory, causing him to forget what he witnessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was around this point that Cléo noticed a magic item in the pockets of Kissime. She decided to confront him, which caused Kissime to panic even more, leading to him frenzying, trying to escape this place

        </p>
        <p>
            The team stood in the way of the backstage exit, causing Kissime to flee using the only exit available ... by jumping through the window of the boat. Captain followed suit to save him, after yelling at others to get his boat</p>
        <p>
            The team got on Captain's boat after Kissime and the captain were hauled from the water by a small rescue boat. On there, Kissime got an explanation of what it means to be a vampire from Cléo, and Lorenzo got a bite to eat from a groupie of his, who is still recovering on the ship.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Kissime is a fledgling, the team decided to present him towards one of the two princes, as is tradition (and to avoid getting in trouble). They decided to go to the Prince of the East side, the Lasombra prince Lucia D'Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
            While waiting in the Medici Chappel for the Prince, a shadow dropped over the crew, causing a silence that choked out all sound. 
            <br>
            The crew presented Kissime as a new fledgling, explaining that they had no idea who turned in, and showed the magic stone towards The Prince, who identified it as a bloodstone, a tracking device created from Tremere blood magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst at first polite, as a ruler should be, Kissime's disrespect infuriated her, causing her to lose her patience. 
            Now the team has one week time to figure out:
            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who sired Kissime?</li>
            <li>Why they sired him?</li>
            <li>Why they decided to place a tracking bloodstone on him.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If they fail to do so, they'll be greeted with their first sunrise since the afterlife started.
        </p>
